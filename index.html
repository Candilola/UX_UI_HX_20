        <P>THIS CASE STUDY is a fictional project that we embarked on as students to redesign a not for profit organisation's website. We chose Story Dogs for this assignment because when we discovered their website we not only fell involve with the adorable dogs but also the Story Dog mission.
        </P>
        <p>STORY DOGS is a wonderful not-for-profit organization that helps over 2400 children across Australia each week. Their literacy program focuses on building reading and literacy confidence in primary age students by having them read to dogs. 
        </p>
        <P>The  goal of  this project was to update the Story Dogs website to create a better user experience while maintaining the feelings of warmth and joy the current website provides. The website had a large and unwieldy navigation system that appears to have grown out of control as the organisation expanded and an overwhelming amount of content that felt like a barrier to attracting potential new volunteers.</P>
        <P>The redesign had 4 key processes. Research, wireframing, testing and iteration. </P>
        <h6>THE USER</h6>
        <P>The Story Dogs website contained a rich resource of information about it's volunteers (users) which informed the proto persona</P>

        <h6>MEET THE USER</h6>
        <P>This is Sue, Sue is a retired teacher who is passionate about education. She enjoys the freedom of retirement but is not ready to give up her connection to education. Sue wants to feel useful and wants to use her skills and experience to give back to the community. Sue is also a dog lover, she has a Irish wolfhound named Molly, who she adores</P>
        <h6>SUE'S STORY</h6>
        <p>Sue heard about story dogs wants to register herself and Molly as volunteers as it is a cause she believes in and she knows that filling her spare time by helping others is a good way to stay connected and involved in the local community, Sue feels this will create a more fulfilling life and ultimately improve her health and happiness 
        </p>
        <h2 class="pull-quote">How might we help users connect with Story dogs to find everything they need to know about becoming a volunteer, in a way that is easy and hassle free, giving users a pleasant and memorable user experience making them feel happy, confident and excited about volunteering.
        </h2>
        <h6>THE KEY ISSUES</h6>
          <p>User tests and heuristic evaluation revealed issues with content organisation and navigation. A lack of information hierarchy, particularly on the homepage and an overwhelming and unconventional navigation system needed to be addressed. Users also had difficulty locating key information due to excessive text and poor content layout.
